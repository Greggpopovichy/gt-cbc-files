mongo is a noSQL database
it uses BSON - compressed JSON
they are easier to implement than sql servers

SQL requires you to have knowledge of the schema. Mongo does not.

Mongo databases are comprised of multiple collections. the collections are comprised of multiple documents.
-think of collections as tables
-think of documents as rows
-think of fields as columns

Mongo advantages:
-horizontal scalability
-you can change mongo's 'schema' on the fly
-large community

SQL makes more sense if you're working with a lot of relational data. If you are working with alot of analytics, sql is probably better.
